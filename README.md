## Hello!

![Profile](/assets/ProfilePhoto.jpg)

My name is Joshua Lee, and I am currently studying for a BS in Electrical Engineering. I reside in Georgia and am attending Georgia Tech. My interests within my field are in robotics and electronic devices. My technical skills include programming (primarily in C), CAD programs such as AutoCad, and software such as Git and Microsoft. Other skills include proffesional presentation and communication within team environment.

## Career goals:

2023-24

I plan on joining a Vertically Integrated Program at Georgia Tech, where I would be gaining research and lab experience in the field of robotics. This experience would further my scope and perspective in the field or give me a better focus on where exactly I'd like to work. I also will be looking for companies to intern over the summer at. I want to try different positions at different companies to further explore my future.

2025-6

By 2026 I plan on graduating with an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and am hoping to get a job right away. However, I still am considering graduate school and may pursue a Master's degree after undergraduate.
